###Wii U  
The chip that has the red and grey wires is the 5ghz module for the gamepad, which then means that the others are not that hard to figure out. :)  
(red and grey (as established before) are for gamepad)  
(black and white are for 2.4ghz wireless)  
(the one without wires is for bluetooth)
