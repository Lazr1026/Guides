What you need: An already modded Wii U (that being with Mocha, Haxchi, or CBHC) A big enough SD Card (64GB+) Mocha CFW (You can skip this if you've modded your Wii U with Mocha.) config.ini (You can skip this if you've modded your Wii U with Mocha.) SD Card setup Copy the wiiu folder from the mocha.zip to the root of your SD Card. Copy the config.ini to wiiu/apps/mocha on your SD Card. Make a copy of your entire SD Card to a safe place on your PC as it will be formatted. redNAND setup Insert the SD Card into your Wii U. Launch Mocha CFW CBHC: Click on the CBHC icon and press the HOME button when you see the Autobooting... screen and choose Mocha CFW . Haxchi: Launch Haxchi while holding the A button. This should load the HBL. After HBL has been loaded navigate to Mocha CFW and select Load . Mocha: Launch the HBL and load Mocha CFW . You will see a screen that says to format your SD Card, press the POWER button on your Wii U to do so. After that you will have to wait for the redNAND to be created. (This will take 30m-2hr depending on your model.) When it is done you should boot into redNAND. Turn off the console for now. Put your SD Card in your PC and copy all the files you backed up before formatting the SD Card. You're done! You have now made a redNAND for god knows why. Notes Note for CBHC Users: You can press the HOME button when you see the Autobooting... screen to then select Mocha CFW to boot into redNAND Note for Haxchi Users: You can edit your config.ini in sd:/haxchi to have it load up mocha when you open the app automatically/hold a button. Note for Mocha Users: You can hold B while loading Mocha to then chose whether if you want to boot redNAND or not. (No boots to sysNAND, Yes boots to redNAND.) Note for all Users: You cannot use the vWii in any way (such as Wii/GCN injects or the Wii Menu).

This Guide only covers the SLC (Wii U). Usually if you need to restore vWii NAND, there is vWii NAND Restorer (Needs backup) or vWii Decaffenator (Doesn't need backup) Wii U doesnt have something like that yet though... so we have to open up the console and solder some wires to the NAND. To unbrick the Wii U we will use an Rasberry Pi. I have only ever used an RPI0 but the pinouts should be the same on every RPI. If you want to use a Teensy to unbrick, refer to this guide What you need An slc.bin dump from before the brick, or an otp.bin dump. A Raspberry Pi and MicroSD for the Raspberry Pi. Decent soldering equipment. Decent soldering skills. Ability to follow instructions. A Lot of time. A Decent understanding of Linux. Last but not least, A Brain. Setting up the software Set up RPIOS on a MicroSD. (Guide: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html ) Power on your RPI and connect it to the internet. Open up a terminal ( CTRL ALT T ), run wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lazr1026/Guides/main/files/unbrick/pinand.sh && chmod +x pinand.sh . Now run ./pinand.sh . Solder the RPI to Wii U board Take apart the Wii U, look up a teardown. Make sure you are VERY CAREFUL when soldering to these points. one mess up and your console may be dead for good. Solder Points: RPI: Wii U Board: It should look like this when finished. Use that pad off to the side as GND . (Taken from Kaflukes CBHC Hardmod Guide) Fixing the NAND Note: Now depending on what the hell you did, you could be doing something WAY different. We will be fixing a CBHC Brick here. FIXING THE NAND WITH ONLY OTP.BIN Download Eyekeys NAND Tools and extract the zip somewhere on your PC. Put the Wii U back together enough to get everything plugged in (Disc Drive, Power Button, Fan, Heatsink.) Power on the Wii U. Turn on the RPI. Open up a terminal and run sudo ./pinand 50 read_id , you should get something like this. Run sudo ./pinand 50 read_full 0 262144 slc.bin . Wait for it to finish reading. (DO NOT UNPLUG THE WII U OR RPI.) Turn off the Wii U and RPI, insert the RPI' MicroSD in your PC. Copy the slc.bin from sd:/home/[USER] to the NAND Tools folder on your PC. (Hint: Now would be a REALLY good time to copy otp.bin to the folder as well.) Open a Command Prompt and run nandCbhcRemover.exe slc.bin . See the next section for flashing the NAND back to the Wii U. FIXING THE NAND WITH ONLY SLC.BIN Insert the RPI' MicroSD in your PC. Copy slc.bin to sd:/home/[USER] . (OTP Only Users: Click Replace when asked.) Insert the RPI' MicroSD into the RPI. Turn on the Wii U. Turn on the RPI. Open a terminal and type in sudo ./pinand 50 read_id . You should get something like this. Run sudo ./pinand 50 erase_blocks 0 4096 && sudo ./pinand 50 write_full 0 262144 slc.bin . Wait for it to finish, this will take a LONG time (around 2 days). (DO NOT UNPLUG THE WIIU OR THE RPI.) After Flashing Turn off the Wii U. Turn off the RPI. Put the Wii U back together enough to test if it boots, plug in Disc Drive, Power Button, Fan, Heatsink. Turn on the Wii U, connect an HDMI or AV (or if your Gamepad is still paired, that works too). -If it loads to Wii U Menu, congrats, desolder the wires on the Wii U Board and put the system back together. You have successfully done the RPI Hardmod Method. -If it does not load to Wii U Menu and Errors, then you did something wrong, or you used the wrong backup. Try Flashing again, or join Ivy's Stuff and ask for help in #help Credits: Theres too many people to list, but if you have talked to me on discord chances are you have helped.
